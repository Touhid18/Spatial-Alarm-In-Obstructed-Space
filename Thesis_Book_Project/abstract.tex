\hspace{3ex} Spatial Alarms are personalized Location Based service(LBS), that are triggered by a specific location of a moving user, instead of time. In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm to evaluate spatial alarm queries in obstructed space. Existing work in this area has focused mainly on Euclidean distance and road network models. The key idea of our approach is to compute a specific region within which the answer set of our query remains unchanged. Our aim is to reduce redundant computations in client side, while preserving the accuracy of the alarms triggered.
