\hspace{3ex} The proliferation of location-based social networks allows people to access location-based services as a group. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach to process Group Trip Planning (GTP) queries in road networks, which enable a group to plan a trip with a minimum aggregate trip distance. The trip starts from the source locations of the group members, goes via different point of interests (POIs) such as a restaurant, shopping center and movie theater, and ends at the destination locations of the group members. The aggregate trip distance can be the total or the maximum trip distance of the group members. We exploit elliptical properties to refine the search region for the POIs and develop efficient algorithms to evaluate GTP queries. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms a naive approach significantly both in terms of query processing time and I/Os. Our approach is on average 17 and 40 times faster than the naive approach and requires 51 and 58 times less I/Os than the naive approach for minimizing total and maximum trip distances, respectively.
