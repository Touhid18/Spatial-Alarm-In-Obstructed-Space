First of all, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to our supervisor Dr. \hspace{-0.8ex}Tanzima Hashem for introducing us to the fascinating world of spatial databases, guiding us through the path of conducting successful research and above all for always being there as our mentor. She shared her wisdom with us in analyzing subject matters and at the same time valued our thinking approach to synthesize those topics. Her suggestions drove us towards better ways of thinking, her reviews enriched us in solving research problems, and her support gave us strength at the time of our disappointment. We shall forever cherish the memories of working with her. 

We would like to sincerely thank Sukarna Barua for his guidance and encouragement in developing our thesis work. Our very special thanks remain for Dr. \hspace{-0.14ex}Mohammed Eunus Ali for all his valuable reviews and remarks towards the dissertation. During the thesis work evaluation process, the teachers of our department made valuable comments which helped us a lot in refining our work. We express our gratitude to them all.

We are indebted to Md. Shahin Pramanik, a member of the Samsung Innovation Laboratory, who provided us with a congenial research environment in the lab while we were conducting our work there.

Last but not the least, we deeply thank our friends and families for always believing in us even at the moment when we were losing our believes in ourselves. We are forever grateful to them for their selfless support and understanding.
